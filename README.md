**Note: This project is currently in active development and is not feature complete**

This project is a continuation of [my former design](https://github.com/RuberDuck9/ryft-16), which I felt the need to expand upon. Initially, I intended to rewrite my old design with a more advanced instruction set, however, I have since decided that the best way to move forward is by adopting the Risc-V ISA instead. My goal with this new processor is to fully implement the Risc-V 32I base integer instruction set within an HDL (Verilog). Once the simulation passes all tests, I will transition my HDL code into a KiCad schematic and actually implement the design in hardware.
